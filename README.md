# A-Classification-Project-The-Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of telecommunications, where connectivity is the cornerstone of modern life, the challenge of retaining customers amidst fierce competition looms large. This article embarks on a journey through the realm of customer churn analysis within the telecommunications sector, leveraging the CRISP-DM methodology as our compass. By following the iterative stages of business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment, we navigate the intricate landscape of churn dynamics with clarity and precision. This is how the model will be used at each phase;
* Business understanding: In this initial phase, the focus will be on understanding the business objectives and goals related to customer churn.
* Data understanding: This phase involves gathering, exploring, and assessing the available data sources related to customer behavior, service usage, and churn.
* Data preparation: Data preparation involves preprocessing and cleaning the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
* Modelling: Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks will be explored and evaluated to identify the most effective model for churn prediction.
* Evaluation: The evaluation phase focuses on assessing the performance of the churn prediction models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Deployment: In the final phase, the churn prediction models will be deployed into operational systems or decision-making processes within the telecommunications organization.

## Project Scenario
As a data scientist at Vodafone Corporation, a large telecommunication company.
* Vodafone want to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.
* To do this, the business development unit has provided you with data to build a series of machine learning models to predict customer churn.
* The marketing and sales team as well have provided you with some data to aid this endeavor.

## Business Understanding
The primary objective of the telecommunication network company is to reduce customer churn, which directly impacts revenue and profitability. Churn occurs when customers discontinue their services with the company and switch to competitors. The company aims to develop proactive strategies to identify customers at risk of churn and implement retention initiatives to mitigate churn rates.

## Data Understanding
This phase we gather relevant data pertaining to the customer churn analysis. It has two different sets of datasets from two sources; one set is stored in a csv file and the other set is stored in a database. Both datasets have the same number of columns and column names.

## Hypothesis Testing
The following hypotheses was formulated based on the business objectives and data exploration findings.
* Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between the tenure and the churn of customers.
* Alternate Hypothesis: There is a relationship between the tenure and the churn of customers.
Based on the p-value (which is far below the significance level of 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between tenure and churn.

## Answering the Analytical Questions
1. What is the overall churn rate against retained customers?
2. Does churn rate differ based on the payment method?
3. What is the churn rate of customers based on their seniority?
4. What is the churn rate of customers based on their monthlycharges?
5. What is the churn rate of customers based on their contract type?
6. What is the churn rate of customers based on their gender?
